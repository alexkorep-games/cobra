**Product Requirements Document: Project Cobra (Elite Browser Clone)**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

**1. Introduction**

*   **1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the product requirements for "Project Cobra," a web browser-based space trading and combat game inspired by the classic "Elite." It defines the features, functionality, and user experience goals for the initial release (V1.0).
*   **1.2 Project Goal:** To deliver a compelling, single-player spacefaring experience in the browser that captures the core essence of exploration, trading, and combat from the original Elite, accessible to fans of retro gaming and space simulations.
*   **1.3 Target Audience:**
    *   Fans of the original Elite and other classic space simulation games.
    *   Players interested in retro gaming experiences.
    *   Users looking for engaging browser-based games with depth beyond typical casual offerings.
*   **1.4 Scope (V1.0):** The initial release will focus on establishing the foundational gameplay loop: flying a spaceship, navigating between systems, basic trading, rudimentary combat, and space station interaction within a procedurally generated galaxy. It will feature a visual style reminiscent of the original's vector/wireframe graphics. Advanced features like complex missions, alien races (Thargoids), and atmospheric flight are out of scope for V1.0.

**2. Goals & Success Metrics**

*   **2.1 Goals:**
    *   Recreate the fundamental Elite gameplay loop (Trade, Fight, Explore).
    *   Provide an intuitive (within the context of the original's design) control scheme for space flight and combat.
    *   Offer a sense of a large, explorable galaxy through procedural generation.
    *   Evoke the visual and atmospheric feel of the original 8-bit era game.
    *   Ensure stable performance in modern desktop web browsers.
*   **2.2 Success Metrics (V1.0):**
    *   Players can successfully launch, fly, navigate using the galactic chart, perform a hyperspace jump, dock at a station, complete a simple trade (buy low, sell high), and survive at least one basic pirate encounter.
    *   The core flight controls (pitch, roll, yaw, thrust) are functional and responsive.
    *   The game runs without critical errors or crashes during a typical play session (e.g., 30 minutes) on target browsers.
    *   Player progress (credits, location, basic ship status) can be successfully saved and loaded via browser storage.

**3. User Stories / Features**

The following user stories define the core features for V1.0:

*   **3.1 Game Setup & Persistence**
    *   **US01:** As a new player, I want to start a new game so that I begin my career as Commander Jameson with a basic ship (Cobra Mk III equivalent), 100 credits, and a small amount of fuel in the Lave system.
    *   **US02:** As a player, I want to save my current game progress (location, credits, ship status, cargo, rating) so that I can stop playing and resume later from where I left off.
    *   **US03:** As a player, I want to load a previously saved game so that I can continue my career without starting over.

*   **3.2 Space Flight & Navigation**
    *   **US04:** As a Commander, I want to pilot my ship using keyboard controls (pitch, roll, yaw, thrust adjustment) so that I can navigate through space.
    *   **US05:** As a Commander, I want to see a first-person cockpit view with a Heads-Up Display (HUD) so that I have essential flight and ship information readily available.
    *   **US06:** As a Commander, I want the HUD to display my ship's speed, roll/pitch orientation, fore and aft shield strength, fuel level, laser temperature, and energy levels so that I can manage my ship effectively.
    *   **US07:** As a Commander, I want a short-range scanner on my HUD showing nearby objects (ships, station, planet, asteroids) and their relative positions/type so that I have situational awareness.
    *   **US08:** As a Commander, I want to be able to switch between Front, Rear, Left, and Right views so that I can observe my surroundings.
    *   **US09:** As a Commander, I want to use a Hyperspace drive to jump to other star systems so that I can explore the galaxy and travel between markets.
    *   **US10:** As a Commander, I want fuel to be consumed when initiating a hyperspace jump so that travel range is limited and fuel management is necessary.
    *   **US11:** As a Commander, I want to view a Galactic Chart showing nearby star systems and their relative positions/distances so that I can select a hyperspace destination.
    *   **US12:** As a Commander, I want to view basic data about a selected system on the Galactic Chart (e.g., name, distance, economy, tech level) so that I can make informed travel decisions.
    *   **US13:** As a Commander, I want a compass or indicator pointing towards the main station or planet in the current system so that I can easily orient myself for docking or travel.

*   **3.3 Combat**
    *   **US14:** As a Commander, I want to target nearby ships so that I can focus my attacks and see basic target information (like shield strength, if applicable).
    *   **US15:** As a Commander, I want to fire my ship's forward-mounted pulse laser so that I can engage hostile targets or defend myself.
    *   **US16:** As a Commander, I want my laser to have a temperature gauge that increases with firing and requires cooling so that I cannot fire indefinitely, adding a tactical element.
    *   **US17:** As a Commander, I want to launch missiles at my current target so that I can inflict heavy damage (requires missiles equipped).
    *   **US18:** As a Commander, I want my ship to have regenerating fore and aft shields that absorb damage so that I have protection during combat.
    *   **US19:** As a Commander, I want my ship to be destroyed if its shields are depleted and it takes excessive further damage, resulting in game over (unless an escape pod is implemented later).
    *   **US20:** As a Commander, I want to see visual feedback (e.g., flashes, explosions) when ships are hit or destroyed so that combat feels impactful.

*   **3.4 Interaction & Trading**
    *   **US21:** As a Commander, I want to approach space stations (e.g., Coriolis type) so that I can dock and interact with services.
    *   **US22:** As a Commander, I want to manually pilot my ship through the station's rotating docking bay ("mail slot") so that I can successfully dock (requires skill).
    *   **US23 (Optional V1.0):** As a Commander with a docking computer, I want to activate an auto-dock sequence near the station so that docking is automated.
    *   **US24:** As a Commander docked at a station, I want to access a market screen showing available commodities with buy/sell prices so that I can engage in trading.
    *   **US25:** As a Commander, I want market prices to vary between systems based on their economy type so that profitable trade routes can be established.
    *   **US26:** As a Commander docked at a station, I want to buy commodities up to my cargo capacity so that I can transport them for profit.
    *   **US27:** As a Commander docked at a station, I want to sell commodities from my cargo hold so that I can realize profits.
    *   **US28:** As a Commander docked at a station, I want to refuel my ship so that I can perform more hyperspace jumps.
    *   **US29:** As a Commander docked at a station, I want to view my ship's equipment and inventory so that I know my current loadout and cargo status.
    *   **US30:** As a Commander, I want to view my current status (Credits, Combat Rating, Legal Status) so that I can track my career progression.

*   **3.5 Universe & NPCs**
    *   **US31:** As a player, I want the galaxy to feel large and varied, with different star systems having unique names, economies, and descriptions, generated procedurally so that exploration feels rewarding.
    *   **US32:** As a Commander, I want to encounter other ships (NPCs) in space, such as traders and pirates, so that the universe feels alive and presents opportunities/threats.
    *   **US33:** As a Commander, I want pirate NPCs to sometimes attack me, especially if I carry valuable cargo, so that there is risk and combat challenge during travel.
    *   **US34:** As a Commander, I want to gain credits and improve my combat rating by destroying pirate ships (bounties) so that combat is a viable career path.
    *   **US35:** As a Commander, I want my legal status to decrease if I attack non-hostile ships or carry illegal goods, potentially attracting police attention, so that player actions have consequences.

**4. UI/UX Requirements**

*   **4.1 Visual Style:** The game must adopt a retro 3D aesthetic primarily using wireframe or flat-shaded, low-polygon models, reminiscent of the original Elite on 8-bit computers. Colors should be vibrant and high-contrast against a black space background.
*   **4.2 HUD:** The HUD must be clear, legible, and provide immediate access to critical ship status information as detailed in the user stories. Use simple bar graphs, text readouts, and iconic representations.
*   **4.3 Information Screens:** Screens for charts, markets, status, etc., should be accessed via intuitive controls (e.g., mapping keys 1-8 or F1-F8) and present information clearly using primarily text and simple layouts.
*   **4.4 Controls:** Primarily keyboard-based controls for flight and primary actions (firing, targeting, jump, docking). Mouse control for aiming is a potential addition but keyboard-only must be viable. Controls should be responsive.
*   **4.5 Audio:** Include distinct sound effects for key actions (lasers, missiles, explosions, jump drive, docking sounds, UI feedback) to enhance immersion. Include iconic music (e.g., Blue Danube on title/docking) where appropriate.
*   **4.6 Performance:** The user experience should be smooth, targeting 30-60 FPS on typical desktop systems running supported browsers. Loading times between systems (hyperspace) should be minimal.
*   **4.7 Accessibility:** While replicating the original's complexity, ensure text is legible and core HUD elements are distinguishable.

**5. Future Considerations (Post V1.0)**

*   Introduction of more ship types (player and NPC).
*   Expanded equipment options (ECM, fuel scoops, energy bombs, different lasers).
*   Implementation of a mission system.
*   Introduction of Thargoids and related lore/encounters.
*   Planetary information screens and basic planetary visuals.
*   More sophisticated AI behaviors and inter-NPC interactions.
*   Potential for basic texturing or slightly enhanced visual effects while maintaining the retro feel.
